cat("Hello fellow lifeforms! This message is written by a species called humans and comes to you from Earth, the third planet from the star known as the Sun, located in the Milky Way galaxy. Our planet is approximately 4.54 billion years old, contains water, which is essential to our survival, and has approximately 8.7 million species inhabiting it. We have been exploring space for less than 100 Earth-years, but have learned much through our exploits of space, and have long sought to find another source of life beyond our planet. We are excited to make your acquaintance and hope to begin learning more about your kind. How long has your planet existed? Have you always inhabited your current home planet? Do you know of any other forms of life beyond your race and ours? There is much we can learn from one another and we are incredibly eager to commence peaceful introductions. Goodbye for now.")
